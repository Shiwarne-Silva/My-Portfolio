                    <h2>Web Design</h2><br/>
                    <p>Web design involves creating and designing the visual elements, 
                        layout, and functionality of a website to make it visually appealing, 
                        user-friendly, and optimized for functionality. The process involves

                        website is functional and responsive across different devices and platforms, 
                        and designing for mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and SEO. A well-designed

                        effective online presence and can significantly enhance their online visibility,

                        appealing and intuitive to use. UI UX designers must have knowledge
